- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
    
    - Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
    
    - At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

    - Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

    - Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

    - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
